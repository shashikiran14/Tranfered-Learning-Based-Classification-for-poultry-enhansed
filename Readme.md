🐣 Poultry Disease Identifier
A deep learning–based web application that identifies common poultry diseases such as Coccidiosis, Salmonella, Newcastle Disease, or Healthy from chicken feces images using a custom-trained MobileNetV2 model. The application is built using Streamlit and TensorFlow.

🚀 Features
🧠 Predicts poultry disease from uploaded fecal images
✅ Detects: Coccidiosis, Salmonella, Newcastle, Healthy
🎨 Beautiful dark-themed UI
⚡ Real-time predictions with confidence score
🐍 Built with TensorFlow, Streamlit, PIL, and NumPy
🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend/UI: Streamlit (custom HTML/CSS for styling)
Model: MobileNetV2 .h5 file (pretrained Keras model)
Backend: TensorFlow, Pillow, NumPy
